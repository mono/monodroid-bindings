JmDNS bindings
===============

This is the JmDNS bindings for Xamarin.Android which at the moment are not working with JmDNS 3.4.1.

Building
========

Download the JmDNS Jar v3.4.1.
> http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmdns/


Extract the zip and copy the jar file
> jmdns-3.4.1/lib/jmdns.jar
to
> JmDNS/binding/Jars


Samples contains a short sample I found online but it is currently not functional. Was just so I could easily reference the corret binding name.
