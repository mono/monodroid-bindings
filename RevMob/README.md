RevMob bindings
===============

This is the RevMob (http://www.revmobmobileadnetwork.com/) bindings for Xamarin.Android which appear to be working as for RevMob Android SDK v6.8.2.

Building
========

Download the RevMob Android SDK v6.8.2 (newer versions should work fine).
> http://s3.amazonaws.com/sdks/revmob-android-sdk-6.8.2.zip


Extract the zip and copy the jar file
> revmob-android-sdk-6.8.2/revmob-6.8.2.jar
to
> RevMob/binding/Jars


Copy all the JavaDocs and their subfolders from
> revmob-android-sdk-6.8.2/apidocs
to
> RevMob/binding/apidcos

After this everything should be good to go.
